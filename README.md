# Arduino Follow-the-Line Project with QTR Reflectance Sensor

This project is an example of how to use an Arduino board, QTR reflectance sensor, and a motor driver shield to create a simple follow-the-line robot.

## Requirements

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board
- QTR reflectance sensor
- Motor driver shield
- Chassis
- Wheels
- Motors
- Jumper wires
- Battery

## Circuit Diagram

## Code

The code for this project is available in the `follow_the_line.ino` file.

## Installation

1. Download the Arduino IDE from the official website and install it on your computer.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and open the `follow_the_line.ino` file.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking the "Upload" button in the IDE.

## Usage

1. Connect the QTR reflectance sensor and the motor driver shield to your Arduino board according to the circuit diagram.
2. Attach the wheels and motors to the chassis.
3. Connect the motors to the motor driver shield.
4. Connect the battery to the motor driver shield.
5. Turn on the power and place the robot on a black line on a white background.
6. The robot will follow the line until it reaches the end of the line.

## Troubleshooting

If the robot does not follow the line correctly, you may need to adjust the threshold values in the code or adjust the position of the QTR reflectance sensor.
